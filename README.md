# ChatsPlus - Recent, Pinned and Folders for Chats in SillyTavern

SillyTavern is a wonderful tool but very Character-centric, making managing conversations across characters cumbersome. ChatsPlus provides a Chat-centric interface integrated into SillyTavern's UI to address that speed bump.

## Features Overview

### Main Interface & Organization

| Recent and Pinned Chats                        | Folder Organization                          |
| ---------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |

The extension integrates directly into your "Character Management" tab, providing recent chats, search, pinned chats and folders all in the same place. View all your conversations in an organized, easy-to-navigate folder structure with unlimited subfolder organization.

### Chat Management & Customization

| Pin Your Chats                                    | Search Functionality                          | Extension Settings                            |

## Known Issues

- **Renaming a chat**: Renaming a chat from OUTSIDE the ChatsPlus interface may break the internal organization structure! This is due to a limitation on the events SillyTavern emits when renaming a chat. If you rename a chat, please do so from within the ChatsPlus interface to ensure the folder structure remains intact or export your extension data from the "Settings" menu to edit and fix it manually.
- **Yes, it is stitched together**: The extension is stitched together which means sometimes things break. In those cases, please reload the page and it should fix itself. If not, please report the issue on the extension thread in the SillyTavern Discord server.
